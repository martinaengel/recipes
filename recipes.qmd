# Drinks

Here's a classic homemade lemonade recipe that’s refreshing and simple to make.
Classic Lemonade Recipe
Ingredients:

    1 cup (240 ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 4-6 lemons)
    1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
    5 cups (1.2 liters) cold water
    Ice cubes
    Lemon slices (for garnish, optional)
    Fresh mint leaves (for garnish, optional)

Instructions:

    Prepare the Simple Syrup:
        In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water.
        Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved. This will create a simple syrup.
        Remove from heat and let it cool.

    Juice the Lemons:
        While the simple syrup is cooling, squeeze the lemons to extract the juice. You can use a manual or electric juicer.
        Strain the lemon juice through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher to remove any seeds and pulp.

    Mix the Lemonade:
        In the pitcher with the lemon juice, add the cooled simple syrup.
        Add the remaining 4 cups of cold water and stir well to combine.
        Taste the lemonade. If it’s too sweet, add more lemon juice. If it’s too tart, add more water or a bit more simple syrup.

    Chill and Serve:
        Refrigerate the lemonade for at least 30 minutes to chill.
        Serve the lemonade over ice cubes in glasses.
        Garnish with lemon slices and fresh mint leaves, if desired.

Tips:

    Adjust sweetness: Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar based on your preference. You can also use honey or agave syrup as a natural sweetener.
    Add flavors: For a twist, you can add other flavors like strawberries, raspberries, or a splash of cranberry juice.
    Sparkling lemonade: For a fizzy version, replace some of the water with sparkling water or club soda.

Enjoy your refreshing homemade lemonade!
