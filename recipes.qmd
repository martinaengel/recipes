# Baking
## Vegan Brownie

*Ingridients
  + 1 cup all-purpose flour
  + 1 cup coconut sugar or granulated sugar
  + 1/2 cup cocoa powder
  + 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  + 1/2 teaspoon salt
  + 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
  + 1/4 cup melted coconut oil or vegetable oil
  + 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  + 1/4 cup dairy-free milk (such as almond, soy, or oat milk)
  + 1/2 cup dairy-free chocolate chips (optional)

*Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, coconut sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the applesauce, melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and dairy-free milk. Mix until smooth.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
4. If using chocolate chips, fold them into the brownie batter.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs attached.
7. Remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
8. Enjoy your delicious vegan brownies! Optional: Serve with a scoop of dairy-free ice cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar for an extra treat.

Have fun and enjo!
